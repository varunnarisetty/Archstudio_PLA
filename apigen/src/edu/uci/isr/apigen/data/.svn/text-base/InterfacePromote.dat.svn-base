	/**
	 * Promote an object of type <code>$$(BASE_TYPE_INTERFACE_NAME)</code>
	 * to one of type <code>$$(TYPE_INTERFACE_NAME)</code>.  xArch APIs
	 * are structured in such a way that a regular cast is not possible
	 * to change interface types, so casting must be done through these
	 * promotion functions.  If the <code>$$(BASE_TYPE_INTERFACE_NAME)</code>
	 * object wraps a DOM element that is the base type, then the 
	 * <code>xsi:type</code> of the base element is promoted.  Otherwise, 
	 * it is left unchanged.
	 *
	 * This function also emits an <CODE>XArchEvent</CODE> with type
	 * PROMOTE_TYPE.  The source for this events is the pre-promoted
	 * IXArchElement object (should no longer be used), and the
	 * target is the post-promotion object.  The target name is
	 * the name of the interface class that was the target of the
	 * promotion.
	 * 
	 * @param value Object to promote.
	 * @return Promoted object.
