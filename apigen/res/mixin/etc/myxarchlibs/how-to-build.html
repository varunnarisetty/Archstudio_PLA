<h1>Building your Custom Data Binding Library</h1>

<p>Apigen generates a library of .java files that can be compiled
and built into a .jar library to be incorporated into software projects
of your own design.  Once these files are generated, you need to
perform a build to create this .jar file.  You can do this with the
MAB2 automated build system.  To use MAB2 for this, you need:

<ul>
<li>A Java 1.4.2 or later compiler
<li>Apache Ant 1.6.2 or later
<li>The files in the Apigen <code>apigen/etc/myxarchlibs</code> directory.
</ul>

<p><b>Step 1:</b> Download and install a Java compiler; the Sun
Java 2 Software Development Kit (J2SDK) is the most common way to get
this.  You can download this for multiple platforms from the
following URL:

<p><a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html</a>

<p><b>Step 2:</b> Download and install Apache Ant.  You can download
Ant from this URL:

<p><a href="http://ant.apache.org/">http://ant.apache.org/</a>

<p><b>Step 3 (optional):</b> Copy the <code>apigen/etc/myxarchlibs</code> directory
(the directory containing this HTML file) to a location where you want to
generate libraries.  Feel free to rename it to
something more sensible for your project.  For the remainder
of this discussion we will refer to this directory as the <code>myxarchlibs</code>
directory, however.

<p><b>Step 4:</b> Run Apigen and set its output directory to the
<code>.../myxarchlibs/src/</code> directory.  Generate data binding code.

<p><b>Step 5:</b> Open a command prompt window and run Ant in the
<code>myxarchlibs</code> directory.  Make sure you have the environment
variables <code>JAVA_HOME</code> and <code>ANT_HOME</code> set appropriately
for Ant.  This should cause Ant to build and Javadoc your data binding library.
The .jar file it creates will be located in <code>.../myxarchlibs/lib</code>.
Add this .jar file to your classpath and enjoy!
