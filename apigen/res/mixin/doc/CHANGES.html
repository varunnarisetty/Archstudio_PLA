CHANGELOG for Apigen Builds
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Build 1031:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]:
    - Added lookupimplementation.xsd to xADL 2.0 settings file.

Build 1030:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]:
    - Generated libraries now synchronize when accessing the DOM for
      non-threadsafe DOM implementations.
  
Build 1029:
  Scott A. Hendrickson [shendric@uci.edu]:
    - Enumerated values of super types are now included in properties 
      that extend them.
    - Modified XArchMetadataUtils.getTypeMetadata(...) to return
      null rathern than throw an exception when a type cannot be found.
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]:
    - Added analysis.xsd and tronanalysis.xsd schemas to xADL 2.0
      settings file.
      
Build 1028:
  Scott A. Hendrickson [shendric@uci.edu]:
    - Added the creation of metadata information for types and 
      instances.
    - Added command line parameters to ApiGen to add additional
      schema mappings and schemas to process as well as to specify 
      an output folder.
    - Changed the ApiGenGui so that the tables in the mapping and 
      schema picker panels are editable.

Build 1027:
  Scott A. Hendrickson [shendric@uci.edu]:
    - Added the creation of context interfaces and a means to create
      contexts through the IXArchImplementation interface.
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]:
    - Encapsulated the entrypoint to the generated library better.
      Now, all document-level services (create, clone, parse,
      serialize) are handled through an implementation of the class
      IXArchImplementation.  Corresponding methods in XArchUtils are
      still functional but deprecated.  Get the DOM-based (default)
      IXArchImplementation through the 
      XArchUtils.getDefaultXArchImplementation() call.
    - Added the ability to generate libraries based on a settings
      file without bringing up the GUI.  Command-line is:
      java edu.uci.isr.apigen.ApiGen -auto [filename]

Build 1026:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]:
    - Workaround (in DOMUtils) for an obscure Crimson bug that occurs
      when you parse a document, then try to move a node with
      attributes from one parent to another.  This avoids DOM
      (erroneously) throwing WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR. This bug has
      apparently been fixed in J2SDK 1.5 (J2SDK 5.0), so the
      workaround is not applied there.
      Special thanks to Kari Nies [kari@ics.uci.edu]

Build 1025:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]:
    - Added the javasourcecode and sourcecodeeclipse schemas to the
      xADL 2.0 settings file.

Build 1024:
  Justin R. Erenkrantz [justin@erenkrantz.com]:
    - Fix to put the indenting back in getPrettyXMLRepresentation()

Build 1023:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]:
    - Added the pladiff schema to the xADL 2.0 settings file.

Build 1022:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]:
    - Added support for fixed attribute values.  See README.TXT for
      details.  

Build 1021:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]:
    - Fixed a bug that could cause a NullPointerException when
      processing a schema that has an element with minOccurs > 0 and
      maxOccurs > 1 whose type has attributes that are ref'ed.
      Special thanks to Nikunj Mehta [mehta@usc.edu].
    - Fixed a bug that could cause a "can't resolve namespace prefix"
      error when processing a schema that has an element of a
      type imported from another schema, where the imported type
      has attributes that are ref'ed from a third schema via a 
      namespace prefix not defined in the original schema.
      Special thanks to Nikunj Mehta [mehta@usc.edu].

Build 1020:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]:
    - Fixed a latent bug in generated StringReplacerReader that could 
      cause parsing to hang or throw an exception when using a
      non-Crimson parser like Apache Xerces.  
      Very special thanks to Justin Erenkrantz [justin@erenkrantz.com]
      for both finding and fixing the bug.
    - Fixed a few Javadoc inconsistencies between parameter names in
      the Javadoc and parameter names in the actual method signature,
      reducing Javadoc warnings.

Build 1019:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]:
    - Changed the Javadoc parameters in the build files.
      Special thanks to Ebru Dincel [dincel@pollux.usc.edu]
    - Fixed a bug that could cause some functions, among them 
      create functions, from not getting generated into a context
      when the only declaration of the need for that type was in
      a complex type extension in the schema.
      Special thanks to Roshanak Roshandel [roshande@usc.edu]

Build 1018:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]:
    - Fixed a bug that does not properly capitalize base type
      names if they aren't already.
      Special thanks to T. Owen O'Malley [owen@email.arc.nasa.gov]

Build 1017:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]:
    - Added the Menage schema to the xADL 2.0 build settings file.
    - Changed the name of IXArch variable in ImplAttr.dat to
      _x so as not to interfere with attributes called x.

Build 1016:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]:
    - Changed the normative URL for the xArch schema (instance.xsd) in
      the xADL 2.0 schemas to a more stable one; schemas have been
      updated also.

Build 1015:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]:
    - get() and getAll() methods now cache their results instead of
      creating new objects each time.  This should improve performance
      and reduce garbage collector thrashing.
    - isEquivalent() now checks that the two objects are of the same
      class as well.  If they aren't, then they necessarily can't be
      equivalent.

Build 1014:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]:
    - Attribute setXXX() calls now do a clearXXX() call first, just
      like elements.  This means that a clear event will be emitted
      before the set event, which means tools do not have to be
      "psychic" and figure out what the previous value was before
      the set operation if it is needed.

Build 1013:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]:
    - Made getAllxxx() functions more efficient.
  
Build 1012:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]:
    - XArchEvents are now emitted when an element is promoted.
    - XArchEvents for xArch element children now have their target 
      names set as if they were regular IXArchElements (i.e. to the 
      name of the child, rather than "xArch," when possible.
    - Fix in generated XArchUtils.getXSIType() routine that is better
      at guessing an element's xsi:type URI when there is an
      unresolvable prefix.  The only observed case where this happens
      occurs when an element is recontextualized across documents.
      Special thanks to Ping Chen [pingc@hotmail.com]      
      Special thanks to Chris Van der Westhuizen 
      [vanderwe@ics.uci.edu]      
      
Build 1011:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]:
    - Changed official name of the tool to Apigen instead of 'xArch
      Apigen'
    - Made the warning message about a problem setting directory
      less severe; many users assumed this was some sort of fatal
      error.
    - Package-title guesser now handles non-forward-slash file
      separators better.
      Special thanks to Chris Jensen [cjensen@uci.edu]

Build 1010:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]:
    - Fixed obscure bug in generated XArchUtils.java that caused a
      NullPointerException when serializing some documents to XML.
      Special thanks to Ping Chen [pingc@hotmail.com]      

Build 1009:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]:
    - Added targets on clear events for attributes and single elements
      to indicate the value of the element or attribute before it was 
      cleared.
    - Fixed minOccurs and maxOccurs to default to 1 if not specified,
      in accordance with latest schema spec.
      Special thanks to Roshanak Roshandel [roshande@usc.edu]
      Special thanks to Ebru Dincel [dincel@pollux.usc.edu]
      
Build 1008:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]:
    - Added a README.TXT describing how to use the tool and what the
      supported XML schema constructs are.
    - Special thanks to Roshanak Roshandel [roshande@usc.edu]
    - Special thanks to Ebru Dincel [dincel@pollux.usc.edu]

Build 1007:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]:
    - Added support for schema elements with basic types (that is,
      simple types from the xsd: namespace like xsd:string,
      xsd:integer, etc.)  
    - Made "Untyped element" error message more descriptive
    - Fixed some bugs in generated code that occurred when
      the first letter of an XML type name was lowercase.
    - Removed the "main" test driver function from
      the Apigen class to avoid confusion.
    - Special thanks to Roshanak Roshandel [roshande@usc.edu]
    - Special thanks to Ebru Dincel [dincel@pollux.usc.edu]

Build 1006:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]:
    - Added ISR Mighty Automated Build materials to Apigen
      distribution in the build-files/ directory.  These will allow
      Apigen users to easily build their own data binding libraries
      out of the source files that Apigen generates using the
      Apache Ant build tool.
  
Build 1005:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]:
    - Minor revision update to Apigen Alpha 2.8.  Migrated Apigen
      to support 05/2001 XML Schema recommendation.  10/2000 schemas
      are no longer supported.
    - Added CHANGES.TXT to Apigen build.
