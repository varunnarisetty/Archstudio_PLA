SECTION 1: GENERAL USE NOTES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1   Starting Apigen

Apigen requires a virtual machine implementing Java 2, version 1.4 or
better.  The de-facto implementation of such a VM is provided in the
Java 2 SDK, version 1.4, which is available freely for many popular
platforms at:

http://java.sun.com/j2se/

Install J2SDK1.4 (or equivalent) to run Apigen.

Apigen is shipped in an executable JAR (Java Archive) file.  This
JAR file (apigen.jar) is located in the lib/ directory of
the apigen installation.  In many operating systems, you can simply 
double-click the JAR file to run the application.  Otherwise, you 
can perform the equivalent operation by running the following command 
at the command-line:

java -jar apigen.jar

If that fails for some reason, you can invoke the main Apigen GUI
by starting:

java edu.uci.isr.apigen.gui.ApiGenGui

This should start the main Apigen GUI.

                            ----====*====----

1.2   Running Apigen

Running Apigen requires a significant amount of configuration, all
of which can be saved in an Apigen settings file to make things 
easier. Configuring Apigen requires setting up three key parameters:

1.  A set of XML Schema to Location Mappings
2.  A set of XML Schemas for which you want to generate libraries
3.  A destination directory for the generated Java files

Apigen ships with a settings file for the xADL 2.0 Architecture
Description Language in the settings/ directory, called
xADL20.settings.  If you load this settings file and walk through
the Apigen wizard, you'll see that all the settings have already
been filled out.  You can add to them or modify them as you walk
through the wizard; however, your changes will not be saved unless
you choose to save the settings again by clicking the "Save Settings"
button in the last Apigen panel.

*NOTE:  If you see a "Warning: Invalid Directory" message (or a
similar message) when you load settings, it is because the target
(output) directory for those settings is not accessible on the
current machine.  You will be prompted to enter a valid directory
when you get to that point in the Apigen wizard.

When you run Apigen, you will be asked for each of these things in
turn as you progress through the Apigen wizard.  They are described
here:

- XML Schema to Location Mappings -

An XML schema is identified by its normative URI (Uniform Resource
Identifier).  A URI is like a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) except
that it does not necessarily indicate how to find the given resource,
only how to name it.  So, for instance, a schema might have the URI:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/arch/xArch/instance.xsd

but not actually reside at that location (in fact, this one does,
but it's not a requirement).  The normative URI for the schema
is specified in the targetNamespace attribute of the <schema>
attribute in the file.

Because schema locations can differ from their normative URIs, a
mapping must be established between schema URIs and their actual
locations.  The first Apigen wizard panel (after the welcome
screen) asks you to establish a mapping between schema URIs and
their locations.

For each schema being processed (and for each schema referred
to by those schemas), you should include an entry here.  You can
specify the "real" location of a schema as either a file or a 
publicly Internet-accessible URL.  URLs are preferred for the
purpose of schema validation.

Additionally, on this wizard panel, you'll see a checkbox labeled
"Schema locations are 'official.'"  If this box is checked, the
data binding libraries will be constructed with additional code
to insert 'schemaLocation' attributes in XML instance documents.
The schemaLocation attribute provides much the same mapping
between schema URIs and their location for XML document validators.
However, if these locations are temporary or only exist locally
(i.e. files on a single machine), you should not check this box.
As such, it's best to make all schemas available from an Internet-
accessible URL.

- XML Schemas for which You Want to Generate Libraries -

The next Apigen wizard panel asks which schemas for which you 
would like to generate libraries.  You may not want to generate
libraries for each of the schemas specified in the previous
panel, however it's generally a good idea to do this.  Enter
all the schema URIs you wish to process here.

- Library Destination Directory -

The next panel allows you to select the directory where libraries
will be generated.  You must have write access to this directory.

- Generate Libraries Panel -

The final panel of the Apigen wizard allows you to save the
settings you've created so far in a settings file and then process
the schemas.  Any problems or errors are reported during processing.

                            ----====*====----

1.3   Support for fixed attributes

Apigen supports (since build 1022) the fixed="..." attribute for
xsd:attributes.  If a fixed attribute value is specified, the generated
get[AttributeName]() function will always return the fixed value as
stated in the schema, no matter what attribute value is actually in
the XML document (or if one is there at all).  Calling 
set[AttributeName]() with a value other than the fixed value will
throw a FixedValueException. If you want the fixed value to *actually
appear* in the XML document, however (for processing by non-schema-
aware tools that do not use the data binding library), you MUST call
set[AttributeName]() with the fixed value to change the value.

1.4   Auto-generating based on existing settings

Once you've run through Apigen and created a settings file, it is 
possible to run Apigen with no GUI based on the settings in that
file.  The command-line is:

java edu.uci.isr.apigen.ApiGen -auto filename

Where filename is the name of the settings file to load.  Apigen
will immediately begin processing schemas and generating data bindings,
overwriting any files that happen to be in the target directory.

SECTION 2: GUIDELINES FOR SCHEMA AUTHORS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1   Overview

Apigen was a tool developed out of necessity as there was no competent
data binding generator for XML schemas available at the time of its
development.  However, it was not meant to be a generic XML schema
data binding generator, and therefore has restrictions above and 
beyond that of a completely generic tool.  In general, two rules hold:

a.  All Apigen-processable schemas are valid XML schemas.
b.  Not all valid XML schemas are Apigen-processable.

The restrictions that schemas must meet to be Apigen-processable are
documented in following sections.

                            ----====*====----

2.2   Stylistic and Other Rules

In general, it is good to follow certain stylistic constraints when
writing XML schemas.  For instance, all xArch and xADL 2.0 schemas,
to date, follow a single naming convention: Element names follow
the same rules as Java object identifiers, starting with a lowercase
letter and using uppercase letters to indicate the start of new
words, such as:

myElementName

Type names, on the other hand, follow the same rules as Java class
identifiers, starting with an uppercase letter and using uppercase
letteres to indicate the start of new words, such as:

MyComplexTypeName

Following this convention, when possible, will ensure that generated
data bindings don't suffer from Java syntax errors.

Additional constraints or tips for writing schemas include:
 - Don't use type or element names that correspond to Java reserved
   words such as boolean or string.
 - Make the filename of your schema a short, one-word name (with
   the .xsd extension, of course) such as instance.xsd or types.xsd.
 - Use only constructs specified as supported by Apigen (see next
   section)
 - When creating an object that is referred to by a unique identifier
   (where the scope of 'unique' is within the same document), use an
   attribute called 'id' and use the Identifier type from the
   xArch instance schema as the attribute's type.  See the various
   xADL 2.0 schemas for examples of this.
 - In general, you should have one namespace per schema.  Redefinition
   of elements in other namespaces is not supported, nor is adding
   constructs to an existing namespace.

                            ----====*====----

2.3   Supported XML Schema Constructs

Apigen does not support all XML Schema constructs.  However, it does
support a significant and useful subset.  The constructs supported
by Apigen are (namespace is xsd: except where specified):

- <schema> tag, targetNamespace and xmlns attributes
- <simpleType> tag.  All simple types in the data binding libraries
  are treated as Strings, even if they are restricted to be enumerated
  types or regular-expression based, etc.
- Enumerations as restrictions of simple types are modeled as constant
  Strings in the generated interfaces
- <complexType> tag containing elements, attributes, or extending
  an existing simple or complex type.  Complex type restrictions
  are not supported if they reduce the cardiality of a 1+ element
  to 0 or 0/1.
- <sequence> and <choice> tags.  Note that mutual exclusivity
  of <choice> tags is not specifically supported--that is, it
  will be possible to add any of the elements in the <choice>
  tag without affecting the others.  Tools are expected to
  add only one.
- <element> tag.  Names and types must be specified for each element.
  Implicit types (types specified in-line) are not allowed.
  Top-level elements (global elements declared outside a type
  declaration) result in additional functions created in the various
  Context objects to support their addition to an 'any' element
  such as <xArch>
- <attribute> tag.  Names and types must be specified for each 
  attribute.
- Attribute refs (partial support--your mileage may vary here)
- Abstract elements

A Non-Exhaustive list of currently UNsupported constructs:
- Nil/Nillable items
- Annotations/Documentation (ignored)
- Element refs 
- Substitution Groups
- Element/Attribute Groups
- schemaLocation attribute (supported in instance documents, ignored
  in schema documents as Apigen provides explicit support)
- Deriving complex types by restriction
- Redefinition
- ##any support (except in the single case of the top-level
  <xArch> tag.
- Implicitly defined types (e.g. a <complexType> subelement of an
  <element> element).
